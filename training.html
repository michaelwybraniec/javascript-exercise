Why Study JavaScript?
    JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

    Operator	Description
    +	                 Addition
    -	                  Subtraction

   JavaScript Assignment Operators
   Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

   Operator	     Example	  Same As
   =	                  x = y	              x = y
  +=	                 x += y	           x = x + y
  -=	                  x -= y	         x = x - y
  *=	                 x *= y	            x = x * y
  /=	                 x /= y	            x = x / y
  %=                	x %= y       	x = x % y
 <<=	               x <<= y	        x = x << y
 >>=	              x >>= y	        x = x >> y
 >>>=	              x >>>= y      	x = x >>> y
 &=	x                  &= y	                x = x & y
 ^=	x                  ^= y	               x = x ^ y
 |=	x                   |= y	              x = x | y 
 **=	                x **= y	           x = x ** y

 JavaScript Data Types:
      The Concept of Data Types
       In programming, data types is an important concept.
       To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

        Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

        var x = 16 + "Volvo";
        
        JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:

        JavaScript:
          var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
          Result: 20Volvo
          
          JavaScript Types are Dynamic
        JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
 
         Example
        var x;           // Now x is undefined
         x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
          x = "John";      // Now x is a String
          
Null
        In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
          Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
            You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
            
            var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
            person = null;
            
            
            Difference Between Undefined and Null
             undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:

             typeof undefined           // undefined
             typeof null                // object

              null === undefined         // false
              null == undefined          // true
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
////////////////////////Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
Example:
This example calls a function which performs a calculation, and returns the result:

*/
    function myFunction(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    console.log(myFunction(1, 2))
    /*
       
//JavaScript Function Syntax
        A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
        Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
        The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
       
       Ex: 
        function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       // code to be executed
       }
       
       Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
        Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
        Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
        A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.
       
       Function Invocation
        The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
        When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
       When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
       Automatically (self invoked)
       
       
 //Function Return
       When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
       If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
       Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
       
       Ex: This example calls a function which performs a calculation and returns the result:
       
       <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
       <p>This example calls a function which performs a calculation and returns the result:</p>
        <p id="demo"></p>
      <script>
        var x = myFunction(4, 3);
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
       */
    function myFunction(a, b) {
        var x = a;
        var y = b;
        return x * y;
        // or as previously:     return a * b;
    }
    console.log(myFunction(4, 3));

    /*
   Why Functions?
    - You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
    -  You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
   
    Example
    Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
*/
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
        return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
    }
    console.log(toCelsius(77));
    /* 
      The () Operator Invokes the Function
       - Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.
         - Accessing a function without () will return the function definition instead of the function result:
        
        HTML:
         function toCelsius(f) {
          return (5/9) * (f-32);
          }
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius;
         
         
         console.log adopted:
         */
    function toCelsius2(f) {
        return (5 / 9) * (f - 32);
    }
    console.log(toCelsius2);

    /*
    Functions Used as Variable Values
    Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

    Example
    Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

    var x = toCelsius(77);
    var text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
    You can use the function directly, as a variable value:

    var text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
         
         
        HTML (oryginal)
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";

function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
} 


     console.log adopted:
         */
    function toCelsius3(fahrenheit) {
        return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
    }
    console.log("The temperature is " + JSON.stringify(toCelsius3(77)) + " Celsius")
    /*
    
    QUIZ: 

    Not clear:
    
    Use escape characters to alert We are "Vikings".
    var txt = "We are \"Vikings\"";      // why sign '\' isnt after the 3rd ".
    alert(txt);
    
    Find the position of the character h in the string txt.     // is this HTML or JS?
    var txt = "abcdefghijklm";
    var pos = txt.indexOf("h");
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
/////////////////////////////////// Objects:

    Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
     In real life, a car is an object.
     A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
     
     Properties:
     car.name = Fiat
     car.model = 500
      car.weight = 850kg
      car.color = white
      
      Methods:
      car.start()
      car.drive()
      car.brake() 
     car.stop()
 
    All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
    All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
    
    This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
     var car = "Fiat";
     
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
    This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
    
    var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
    
    The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
    JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
    
Object Definition
    You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:
    Example
    var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
    
    Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:
    Example
     var person = {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
      age: 50,
     eyeColor: "blue" 
     };
     
Accessing Object Properties
     You can access object properties in two ways:
     
     objectName.propertyName
     
     or

      objectName["propertyName"]


Object Methods
     Objects can also have methods.
     Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
     Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
     
     Example
     var person = {
     firstName: "John",
     lastName : "Doe",
     id       : 5566,
     fullName : function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
     };
     
The - this - Keyword
     In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
     In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
     In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
     
     

The JavaScript this Keyword 
     https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp
     
     
     
  
Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object

Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
     
     
     
     
     
     

///////////////////// EVENTS

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

HTML Events
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:
<element event='some JavaScript'>

With double quotes:
<element event="some JavaScript">
     
In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element:
Example:   <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
     
    
// Common HTML Events
Here is a list of some common HTML events:

Event	                    Description
onchange	          An HTML element has been changed
onclick	                   The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	     The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout     	  The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	       The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	                  The browser has finished loading the page

The list is much longer: 
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp



What can JavaScript Do?
Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:

- Things that should be done every time a page loads
- Things that should be done when the page is closed
- Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
- Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
- And more ...

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

- HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
- HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
- And more ...





//////////////// Strings
A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

*/
    function stringExample(a, b, c) {
        var a = "It's alright";
        var b = "He is called 'Johnny'";
        var c = 'He is called "Johnny"';
        return a + b + c;
    }
    console.log(stringExample());
    /*

    The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".
    The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.
    The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:


    Special Characters
    Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

    Code	Result	Description
    \'	               '	    Single quote
    \"           	"	       Double quote
    \\	            \	       Backslash
