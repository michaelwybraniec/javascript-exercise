Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

    JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
    Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

    Operator	Description
    +	                 Addition
    -	                  Subtraction
    *	                 Multiplication
    **	                Exponentiation (ES6)
     /	                 Division
   %               	   Modulus (Division Remainder)
    ++	               Increment
    --	                 Decrement
      
   JavaScript Assignment Operators
   Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

   Operator	     Example	  Same As
   =	                  x = y	              x = y
  +=	                 x += y	           x = x + y
  -=	                  x -= y	         x = x - y
  *=	                 x *= y	            x = x * y
  /=	                 x /= y	            x = x / y
  %=                	x %= y       	x = x % y
 <<=	               x <<= y	        x = x << y
 >>=	              x >>= y	        x = x >> y
 >>>=	              x >>>= y      	x = x >>> y
 &=	x                  &= y	                x = x & y
 ^=	x                  ^= y	               x = x ^ y
 |=	x                   |= y	              x = x | y 
 **=	                x **= y	           x = x ** y

     JavaScript Comparison Operators
    Operator	Description
    ==	                equal to
    ===	               equal value and equal type
    !=	                 not equal
    !==	               not equal value or not equal type
    >	                 greater than
    <	                 less than
    >=	               greater than or equal to
    <=	               less than or equal to
    ?	                ternary operator
      
    JavaScript Logical Operators
    Operator	Description 
    &&	               logical and
    ||	                  logical or
    !                   	logical not

      JavaScript Data Types:
      The Concept of Data Types
       In programming, data types is an important concept.
       To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

        Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

        var x = 16 + "Volvo";
        
        JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:

        JavaScript:
          var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
          Result: 20Volvo
          
          JavaScript Types are Dynamic
        JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
 
         Example
        var x;           // Now x is undefined
         x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
          x = "John";      // Now x is a String
          
          Null
        In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
          Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
            You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
            
            var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
            person = null;
            
            
            Difference Between Undefined and Null
             undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:

             typeof undefined           // undefined
             typeof null                // object

              null === undefined         // false
              null == undefined          // true
    */
